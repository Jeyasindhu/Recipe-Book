            marinated chicken pieces cooked in a spiced tomato sauce enriched
            with butter and cream. The chicken is first marinated in a mixture
            of yogurt and spices, then cooked until perfectly charred. It's
            simmered in a luscious sauce made with tomato puree, cream, and
            kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), giving it a unique and
            delightful flavor. Garnished with fresh coriander, this dish is a
            staple in Indian cuisine and beloved worldwide.

          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />500g boneless chicken, cut into cubes <br />1 cup yogurt
            <br />1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste <br />1 teaspoon red chili
            powder <br />1 teaspoon turmeric powder <br />1 teaspoon garam
            masala <br />Salt to taste <br />2 tablespoons butter <br />1 cup
            tomato puree <br />1/2 cup cream <br />1 teaspoon kasuri methi
            (dried fenugreek leaves) <br />Salt to taste
          </p>
          <h3>Instruction:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />1. In a bowl, mix together yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red
            chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. <br />2. Add
            the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated.
            <br />3. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or
            ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to infuse into the chicken.
            <br />4. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan over medium heat.
            <br />5. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are
            fully cooked and slightly charred, stirring occasionally. <br />6.
            Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and set it aside.
            <br />7. In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.
            <br />8. Add the tomato puree and cook for about 10 minutes,
            stirring occasionally, until the puree thickens slightly. <br />9.
            Add the cream, kasuri methi, and salt to taste. Stir well to
            combine. <br />10. Add the cooked chicken pieces back into the pan
            with the sauce. <br />11. Simmer the mixture for 5-10 minutes over
            low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together and the sauce to
            thicken slightly. <br />12. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
            <br />Once the Butter Chicken is ready, garnish it with freshly
            chopped coriander leaves. <br />13. Serve hot with naan bread, rice,
            or your preferred side dish.<br />14. Enjoy your homemade Butter
            Chicken!

            Chole, also known as Chickpea Curry, is a beloved dish from North
            India. It features chickpeas (chole) simmered in a rich, flavorful
            gravy made with onions, tomatoes, and an array of aromatic spices.
            This hearty and nutritious curry is traditionally served with rice,
            bhature (fried bread), or roti. The combination of tender chickpeas
            and a spicy, tangy sauce makes it a favorite in Indian cuisine,
            offering a delightful blend of textures and flavors.

            rinsed) <br />Water for soaking and cooking <br />Salt to taste
            <br />2 tablespoon oil <br />1 teaspoon cumin seeds <br />2 onion,
            finely chopped <br />2 tomatoes, pureed<br />2 green chilies, slit
            <br />1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste <br />1 teaspoon turmeric
            powder <br />1 teaspoon garam masala<br />1 teaspoon red chili
            powder <br />1 teaspoon coriander powder <br />1 teaspoon amchur
            (dry mango powder)<br />Salt to taste<br />Fresh coriander leaves,
            chopped
          </p>
          <h3>Instruction:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />1. If using dried chickpeas, soak them in water overnight.
            Drain and rinse them. <br />2. Cook the soaked chickpeas in a
            pressure cooker with enough water and a pinch of salt until they are
            soft and tender. If using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them,
            then proceed to the next step. <br />3. Heat oil in a large pan over
            medium heat. <br />4. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
            <br />5. Add chopped onions and cook until they turn golden brown.
            <br />6. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 2 minutes until the
            raw smell disappears. <br />7. Add pureed tomatoes, turmeric powder,
            red chili powder, and coriander powder. <br />8. Cook the mixture
            until the oil separates from the masala. <br />9. Add the cooked
            chickpeas to the masala and mix well. <br />10. Add garam masala and
            amchur. Stir to combine. <br />11. Add salt to taste and simmer the
            curry for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
            <br />12. If the curry is too thick, you can add a little water to
            reach the desired consistency. <br />13. Garnish the Chole with
            freshly chopped coriander leaves. <br />14. Serve hot with rice,
            bhature, roti, or naan. <br />15. Enjoy your Chole, a comforting and
            flavorful dish that's perfect for a satisfying meal!

            Tandoori Chicken is a popular Indian dish consisting of chicken
            marinated in a mixture of yogurt and aromatic spices, then roasted
            to perfection. Traditionally cooked in a tandoor (clay oven), the
            chicken achieves a smoky flavor and a charred exterior while
            remaining tender and juicy inside. The marinade, typically red due
            to the use of chili powder and sometimes food coloring, infuses the
            chicken with a rich, complex flavor. Tandoori Chicken is often
            served with naan, rice, and a side of fresh salad, making it a
            complete and satisfying meal.

        <div class="meal-instruct">
          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />1 cup yogurt <br />2 tablespoons lemon juice <br />1
            tablespoon ginger-garlic paste <br />1 teaspoon turmeric powder
            <br />1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste) <br />1 teaspoon
            garam masala <br />1 teaspoon cumin powder <br />1 teaspoon
            coriander powder <br />1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for
            color and smokiness) <br />Salt to taste <br />Red food coloring
            (optional, for traditional red color) <br />4-6 chicken legs or
            thighs, skinless <br />Lemon wedges <br />Fresh coriander leaves,
            chopped <br />Sliced onions
          </p>
          <h3>Instruction:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />1. Make deep slits in the chicken pieces to allow the marinade
            to penetrate.

            <br />2. In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice,
            ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam
            masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, smoked paprika (if using),
            salt, and red food coloring (if using). <br />3. Add the chicken
            pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and
            refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight for best
            results.

            <br />4. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). If you have a grill
            function, you can use it to achieve a more authentic char.

            <br />5. Line a baking tray with aluminum foil and place a wire rack
            on top. Arrange the marinated chicken pieces on the rack. <br />6.
            Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, turning the
            pieces halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and has
            a slight char. For a more authentic flavor, you can grill the

            Samosa is a popular Indian snack consisting of a crisp, flaky pastry
            filled with a savory mixture of spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes
            meat. This triangular-shaped delicacy is deep-fried to golden
            perfection, making it irresistibly crunchy on the outside and
            deliciously flavorful on the inside. Samosas are often served with
            chutneys such as mint or tamarind and are a favorite at parties,
            street stalls, and as an appetizer in Indian cuisine.

          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />2 cups all-purpose flour <br />1/4 cup oil or ghee <br />1/2
            teaspoon salt <br />Water (as needed)

            <br />3 large potatoes, boiled, peeled, and mashed <br />1/2 cup
            green peas (fresh or frozen) <br />1 tablespoon oil <br />1 teaspoon
            cumin seeds <br />1 teaspoon mustard seeds (optional) <br />1 onion,
            finely chopped <br />2 green chilies, finely chopped <br />1
            tablespoon ginger-garlic paste <br />1 teaspoon turmeric powder
            <br />1 teaspoon coriander powder <br />1 teaspoon garam masala
            <br />1 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder) or 1 tablespoon lemon
            juice <br />Salt to taste <br />Fresh coriander leaves, chopped

            <br />Oil for deep frying
          </p>
          <h3>Instruction:</h3>
          <p>
            <br />1. In a large bowl, mix the all-purpose flour and salt.
            <br />2. Add the oil or ghee and rub it into the flour until the
            mixture resembles coarse crumbs. <br />3. Gradually add water, a
            little at a time, and knead to form a firm, smooth dough. <br />4.
            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.

            <br />5. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. <br />6. Add cumin
            seeds and mustard seeds (if using) and let them splutter. <br />7.
            Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. <br />8. Add
            the green chilies and ginger-garlic paste, and cook for 2 minutes
            until the raw smell disappears. <br />9. Add the peas and cook for
            another 2-3 minutes. <br />10. Add the mashed potatoes, turmeric
            powder, coriander powder, garam masala, amchur (or lemon juice), and
            salt. Mix well to combine. <br />11. Cook for a few more minutes,
            stirring occasionally, until the mixture is well heated and the
            spices are blended. <br />12. Stir in the chopped coriander leaves
            and remove from heat. Let the filling cool.

            <br />13. Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion
            into a ball. <br />14. Roll out each ball into an oval or circle,
            about 6 inches in diameter. <br />15. Cut the rolled dough in half
            to form two semi-circles. <br />16. Take one semi-circle and fold it
            into a cone shape, sealing the edge with a little water. <br />17.
            Fill the cone with 1-2 tablespoons of the potato filling. <br />18.
            Seal the top edge of the cone by pinching the edges together,
            ensuring there are no gaps. Repeat with the remaining dough and
            filling.

            <br />19. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. <br />20.
            Once the oil is hot, carefully add the samosas in batches and fry
            until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides. <br />21.
            Remove the fried samosas with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
            towels.

            <br />22. Serve the hot samosas with mint chutney, tamarind chutney,
            or your favorite dipping sauce. <br />23. Enjoy your Samosas, a
            delightful and savory snack that’s perfect for any occasion!

      <h2 class="meal-name">Dosa</h2>

        <h3 class="meal-title-about">About Meal</h3>
        <p class="meal-descript-about">
          Dosa is a traditional South Indian dish that resembles a thin, crispy
          pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram
          lentils). It is renowned for its delicate texture and slightly tangy
          flavor due to the fermentation process. Dosas are typically served hot
          with a variety of accompaniments such as sambar (a lentil-based
          vegetable stew) and coconut chutney. They are a staple breakfast item
          in South India but are enjoyed at any time of the day across India and
          around the world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="meal-instruct">
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>
          <br />2 cups rice (preferably parboiled rice) <br />1 cup urad dal
          (split black gram lentils) <br />1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
          <br />Water (for soaking and grinding) <br />Salt to taste

          <br />Oil or ghee (for cooking the dosas)
        </p>
        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
        <p>
          <br />1. Rinse the rice and urad dal separately under cold water until
          the water runs clear. <br />2. Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds in
          one bowl and the urad dal in another bowl with enough water for at
          least 4-6 hours, or overnight.

          <br />3. Drain the soaked urad dal and grind it to a smooth and fluffy
          batter, adding a little water as needed. <br />4. Drain the soaked
          rice and fenugreek seeds and grind them to a smooth batter, adding
          water as needed. <br />5. Combine both batters in a large bowl, mix
          well, and add salt to taste. <br />6. Cover the bowl and let the
          batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight until it
          doubles in volume and becomes slightly frothy.

          <br />7. Stir the fermented batter gently. If it is too thick, add a
          little water to achieve a pourable consistency. <br />8. Heat a
          non-stick skillet or a traditional cast-iron dosa tawa (griddle) over
          medium-high heat. <br />9. Once hot, drizzle a few drops of oil and
          spread it with a cloth or paper towel to lightly grease the surface.
          <br />10. Pour a ladleful of batter in the center of the tawa and
          quickly spread it out in a circular motion with the back of the ladle
          to form a thin, even layer. <br />11. Drizzle a few drops of oil or
          ghee around the edges and on top of the dosa. <br />12. Cook until the
          dosa turns golden brown and crispy. Flip if you prefer it cooked on
          both sides, although traditional dosas are usually cooked on one side
          only.

          <br />13. Serve the hot dosa immediately with sambar, coconut chutney,
          or any other preferred accompaniments. <br />14. Enjoy your Dosa, a
          delicious and crispy South Indian delight that's perfect for any meal!
